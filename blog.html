                    <p id="para"> Cryptocurrency & more specifically, its tenants like decentralization & trust have had profound effects on my life!  The man I would soon become was fortuitous reading the tale of 
                        a man named Satoshi & an immaculate conception of what I can only describe in hindsight as a miracle, wrapped in a mysterious orange container. 
                        </p><p class="semi">
                        Little did I know at the time, this enigmatic inspiration that we now know as Bitcoin had sparked a quest for knowledge so powerful inside of me that
                         I hardly recognize the person that I was beforehand.  One man's tulip mania is another's salvation & as my insight into the problems facing our 
                         species in this epoch grew, I grew hungry for the foresight to disentangle the countless souls who have lost their freedom.  
                    </p><p class="lit">
                        The truth is that I had become complacent against my training & better judgment.  Digital currency, its permissionless nature & censorship resistance 
                        woke me from my slumber & Software Engineering released me from my melancholy.  Today I ride on the shoulders of the giants who have created such 
                        algorithmic beauty before me.  Now, I stand before you reinvigorated with an unwavering commitment to my fellow humans.  
                        </p><p id="para">
                        This conscious experience has been quite enlightening & the path has hardened my resolve & leveled up my spirit.  Every passing day provides me 
                        with novel opportunities to learn, grow, and teach others.  It's become clear that if I play my cards right, I could help provide our future 
                        generations with a chance at bliss.  The harsh realities I experienced growing up set me up well for my purpose to be a leader of the people. </p>

                    <p class="lit"> The stakes have never been higher.  After the Covid pandemic, I clung to crypto as a life raft.  As I proudly forecasted, the Play-To-Earn
                         gaming sector blew up.  My background in Economics & Finance was essential.  What made me successful was that I put the time into researching 
                         & learning like a sponge, absorbing every bit of knowledge I could find.   There is beauty in that anyone can break into web 3 & when the bear
                          market came, I knew it was my chance.  In 2022 I spent a minimum of 60 hours a week learning and began working as a consultant, building 
                          freelance web applications, and cramming several JS Codwars algorithms a day on average.  As a Conspiracy Scientist, I spend any free time 
                          I can afford researching converging & potentially disruptive fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Biotechnology, Cognitive Sciences,
                          Nanotech, Sociology, Information Technology, & Memetics.  However, my critical thinking skills & interest in power dynamics give me quite
                           the advantage in the clowns existence we're experiencing.
                    </p>
                    <p id="para">
                        It is pertinent to my mission that I’m capable of forecasting future trends, & technology has been expanding exponentially as we
                         impatiently approach simultaneous revolutions in Information Technology & Biotechnology. 

Climate change perceived or factual, more sophisticated biological agents, & AI alignment problems seem to paint a picture of rapid change over the next decade.  
This trio is ammo to strike fear in the hearts of the accommodating general public, fueled by a massive industrial complex with beyond corrupt legacy 
media channels, a public education system that breeds drones, and social norms that encourage division.  The knowledge I've gained already has forced me to change the way I 
communicate with everyone I come across on my journey because the reality is disturbing & ignorance is bliss.  Personally, I would rather know about 
the roadblocks facing our kind & how others seek to manipulate & ultimately control our behavior.

                    <p class="semi">
                        Seeing the world through my eyes lately sure feels like watching a skilled player of Go, Poker, or even Spades.  The people are
                         pieces & often played against each other in ways unbeknownst to most, whether it be in politics, war, business, & even 
                         the entertainment we consume.  Glorified hedgefunds with monopolistic tendencies have massive control over so many lives that haven't the slightest clue 
                         of their existence. BlackRock runs on Aladdin, Data is the new oil, & there is an illusion of choice.
                          So I've decided to start what we're calling Enigmatic AI which seeks to solve spikes in 
                         technological employment that I've anticipated as we transition to a gig & creator based economy. 
                         
                         
                         </p><p class="lit">Now it's become abundantly clear that the people who have the 
                         money & power could care less about poverty, unlawful experiments on the population, or creating a functional economy that 
                         distributes wealth efficiently & effectively to those you could use it.  I know all to well what it's like to be hungry & not know
                         what my next meal will be, or how long I will have a roof over my head.  From a game theoretical perspective, the elite that has the power to fix the 
                         traditional system has a strong incentive not to do so & to inhibit the attempts of any that do.  Enigmatic AI looks to leverage 
                         advances across diverse fields to create the Enigma.  A Community enhanced with the capabilites of AI, who will receive
                          top-of-the-line education and training, well empowering each other to create The decentralized educational infrastructure
                           that our species deserves.  This is not going to happen overnight but a man can dream.  If anything, I've always been quite the dreamer.  The dream is what keeps me fighting
                           day after day, on a pursuit for the knowledge & freedom I deserve. Now I seek the power to help those in need that society has seemingly forgotten about, only just realizing they are 
                           on the fast track to becoming equally lost.  Meanwhile it appears that everything around me is breaking down, as if it was designed to fall apart so perfectly.

                     </p>   <p id="para">
Make sure to keep an eye out for continuations of this series of blog articles where I will release alpha about the list of project use cases I've
 already put together to ensure the enigma have all the resources required to guide the weaker of our species.  Enigmatic AI will establish significant 
 labor along the way & please reach out with any ideas or feedback that you think may be valuable.  As I'm sick of people telling me that there is 
 nothing they can do because we're just cogs in a machine or some similar defeatist excuse as to why we should just hope that things work out,
  which I can't imagine makes a successful alignment with AI any more likely.  My interpretation is that AGI would be keener to align itself with 
  an adaptable species that work together to maximize the expected value of the whole!  I'm seeking any opportunties to grow my skills, sustain my research,
  & help todays founders with the projects they hold so very dear, as I do my dream of enigmatic AI.
